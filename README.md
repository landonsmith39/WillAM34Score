# Will AM34 Score
This is a project for my machine learning class. Simple machine learning model investigating whether Auston Matthews will score in his next game.

First I am investigating how much home vs. away affects AM's scoring.
Away - AM is predicted to score at least one goal 46.8%.
Home - AM is predicted to score at least one goal 51.6%.

I plan to look at team strength next.
